On it's own the game is really nothing special, the story behind it's creation is honestly more interesting. 
The game is a short collection of mini-games about the COV-19 pandemic.

While creating the game, I wanted to experiment with creating a hyper-casual mobile game, as such the game mechanics are relatively simple.
