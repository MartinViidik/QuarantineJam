On it's own the game is really nothing special, the story behind it's creation is honestly more interesting. 

The game is a short collection of mini-games about the COVID-19 pandemic and how you should act in this situation. You get points by doing activities such as washing your hands, wearing protective gear, buying supplies responsibily, following the 2+2 rule etc

While creating the game, I wanted to experiment with creating a hyper-casual mobile game, as such the game mechanics are relatively simple. (User input consists of simple gestures like tapping, swiping etc). I also used it as a chance to experiment with things I haven't really attempted before, such as localization into different languages, online leaderboards etc
